"""The NVIDIA GSP-firmware suspend quirk must survive every Utah build.

On the 595.x open kernel modules Utah builds from NVIDIA's `.run` installer
(``scripts/install-nvidia.sh``), the GSP firmware's default deep idle
configuration crashes during the suspend unload phase. The kernel log
sequence is:

    NVRM: nvAssertFailedNoLog: ... @ kern_bus_vbar2.c:346
    NVRM: kgspHealthCheck_TU102: * GSP-CrashCat Report *
    NVRM: Xid (PCI:0000:01:00): 1, GSP task exception: load access fault
    NVRM: gpuPowerManagementEnter: GSP unload failed at suspend: 0x65
    NVRM: gpuPowerManagementResume: cannot init libOS PMU logging structures
    NVRM: Xid (PCI:0000:01:00): 119, Timeout after Ns of waiting for RPC ...
    BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: 00000000000026b0
    Oops: 0000 in nvEvoDisableVblankSemControl

-- see projectbluefin/utah#492 and NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules#1271.

The fix is a single modprobe option, ``NVreg_DynamicPowerManagement=0x01``,
in ``system_files/shared/usr/lib/modprobe.d/zz-nvidia-pm.conf``. The file
lives in the shared layer because the option is inert on systems without
the nvidia module (the kernel ignores options for absent modules), so
shipping it on every flavor is safe. The ``zz-`` prefix sorts the file
after common#1176's ``zz-nvidia-suspend.conf``, which pins
``UseKernelSuspendNotifiers=1`` and ``TemporaryFilePath=/var/tmp`` -- a
different failure mode (the driver vetoes suspend), but a sibling quirk
that also has to keep working.

These tests guard three independent regressions:

- the file disappears from the source tree (CI never builds an image with
  the option set),
- the option is removed or mutated to the default ``0x02`` value (silent
  drift back to the crashing behaviour, no kernel-level audit trail),
- the option is left in place but the sort order breaks -- the driver
  package's ``nvidia.conf`` ships at ``/usr/lib/modprobe.d/nvidia.conf``;
  if Utah's file ever loses its ``zz-`` prefix, a duplicate on
  ``nvidia.conf`` would silently win.
